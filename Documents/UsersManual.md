# JSTerminal: Terminal application for JavaScript shell

## Introduction
The *JSTerminal* is a terminal application.
This application has following features:
* _JavaScriptable_: You can write shell script by JavaScript.ã€€The JavaScript shell (named *jsh*) is supported. It extend JavaScript to make shell scripting easier. See [jsh language manual](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTools/blob/master/Document/jsh-lang.md) and [jsh system manual](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTools/blob/master/Document/jsh-sys.md) for more details.
* _GUI Designable_:  You can implement GUI by component based language named [Amber Programming Language](https://github.com/steelwheels/Amber/blob/master/Document/amber-language.md). You can call the script from JavaScript code to display the graphical user interface.
* _Rapid and Interactive Application Development_: There are many built in functions. Especially, the GUI design by Amber Programming Language reduce the code for GUI implementation.
* _Educational_: The interactive JavaScript programming environment helps you to learn JavaScript. The beginner can try 2D graphics programming with minimum effort.

This product is open source software.

## How to use
### Boot
Double click the icon of JSTerminal or execute following command at the `Terminal.app`.
````
open -a /Applications/JSTerminal.app
````

### Setup
At the first boot, the following window will be appeared.
This window is used to select _home directory_ of this application.
The *JSTerminal* is [sandboxed application](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox).
You must select the directory where the application can access it.

1. Push "Select Home Directory" button and select home directory
2. Press "OK" button to finialize the selection

![Setup window](./Images/setup-window.png)

After pressing the "OK" button, you will see the following window:
![Boot window](./Images/boot-window.png)

The word `jsh>` is called prompt. It encourage the input from the user.
Type `ls` on the window. You will see the contents of current directory:
````
jsh> ls
Game
Sample
````

### Set home directory (again)
You can re-define home directory at the [Preference Window](#Preference).

The changing home directory means that you allow this application accesses your files. If you don't like it, do not change the home directory (See [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTerminal/blob/master/Documents/PrivacyPolicy.txt)).

The default home directory is your top home directory.
You can change the `Home directory` section by clicking `select` button:
![Select home directory](./Images/preference-homedir.png)


### Install built-in resource files
The [install command](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTools/tree/master/Document/builtins/install-man.md) is used to install built-in resource files. They will be placed under home directory.

You don't have to install these files. But it helps you to learn how to programming on this environment.

````
jsh> install
Remove directory: /Users/tomoo/Development/Library
Copy directory: file:///Applications/JSTerminal.app/Contents/Resources/Library/ --> file:///Users/tomoo/Development/Library/
Remove directory: /Users/tomoo/Development/Game
Copy directory: file:///Applications/JSTerminal.app/Contents/Resources/Game/ --> file:///Users/tomoo/Development/Game/
Remove directory: /Users/tomoo/Development/Sample
Copy directory: file:///Applications/JSTerminal.app/Contents/Resources/Sample/ --> file:///Users/tomoo/Development/Sample/
jsh> 
````

### Execute shell command
The prompt `'>'` means *shell mode* .
The shell mode accepts shell commands such as `echo` command.
````
jsh> echo "Hello, world"
Hello, world
````
You can execute the JavaScript by prepending `%` at the head of the statement.
````
jsh> % console.log("Hello, world") ;
Hello, world
````
You can switch the *shell mode* into *JavaScript mode* by entering `%` key. The JavaScript mode accepts JavaScript code dynamically.
````
jsh> %
jsh% let a = 10 ;
jsh% console.log("a = " + a) ;
a = 10
jsh%
````
You can switch to shell mode by entering `>` key.
````
jsh% >
jsh> ls
Documents
jsh>
````

### Execute sample script
You can use [run command](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTools/blob/master/Document/builtins/run-man.md) to execute the script (Both JavaScript and Shell scripts are supported).

This is famous demo program for JavaScript.
````
jsh> cat Sample/hello.js
function main(args)
{
	console.log("Hello, world !!") ;
}

jsh> run Sample/hello.js
Hello, world !!
````

This is `jsh` version.
````
jsh> cat Sample/hello.jsh
> echo "hello" | tr [a-z] [A-Z]

jsh> run Sample/hello.jsh
HELLO
````

And this is sample program to test terminal color.
````
jsh> run Sample/colors.js
````
And you will get following outputs:
![Screenshot of script-colors.png](./Images/script-colors.png)

This is sample program using Amber Programming language.
````
jsh> run Sample/table.jspkg
````

And you will get following outputs:
![Screenshot of table.jspkg](./Images/table-screenshot.png)

This is sample program of 2D graphics using Amber Programming language.
````
jsh> run Sample/graphics.jspkg
````

And you will get following outputs:
![Screenshot of graphics.jspkg](./Images/graphics-2d-screenshot-1.png)

This is [turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics).
````
jsh> run Sample/turtle.jspkg
````

And you will get following outputs:
![Screenshot of turtle.jspkg](./Images/turtle-screenshot-1.png)

When the run command is executed without script path, the dialog is used to select the file.
For more details, see [run command](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTools/blob/master/Document/builtins/run-man.md).
You can find the sample JavaScript programs in [sample game scripts](Games/Games.md), [sample GUI scripts](Sample/GUIs.md).

### File extensions
The file extension (such as `.js`, `.jsh`) is refered to determine the contents of the file (or package).
This is the table of extensions that this application supports as a script file.

|Extension  |Contents                       |
|:--        |:--                            |
|.js        |JavaScript Program             |
|.jsh       |JavaScript Shell               |
|.jspkg     |JavaScript package (See next section)  |
|.amb       |[AmberScript](https://github.com/steelwheels/Amber/blob/master/Document/amber-language.md) |

### File package
The bundle of the files are used for scripting. It is called _JavaScript Package_ . You can implement JavaScript program by multiple script files.
For more details, see [JavaScript Package](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTools/blob/master/Document/jspkg.md).
This is sample implementation of `manifest.json` file which presents the bundled files for an application script:
````
{
	application:	"main.js",
	libraries: [
		"lib_a.js",
		"lib_b.js"
	],
	threads: {
		"thread_a": "thread_a.js",
		"thread_b": "thread_b.js"
	}
}
````
The format of `manifest.json` is defined in [extended JavaScript Object Notation](https://github.com/steelwheels/KiwiScript/blob/master/KiwiLibrary/Document/Data/object-notation.md).

### `.jshrc` file
If you put .jshrc JavScript file on your home directory, the file is parsed at the boot time (before outputting 1st prompt).

This is a samle context of `.jshrc` file. You can get the version of shell and change the prompt on the shell by referencing/updating [Preference Object](https://github.com/steelwheels/KiwiScript/blob/master/KiwiLibrary/Document/Class/Preference.md).

````
/* Print version */
console.log("jsh: version: " + Preference.system.version) ;

/* Set prompt */
Preference.shell.prompt = function() {
        let orgcol = Preference.terminal.foregroundColor ;
        let orgesc = EscapeCode.color(1, orgcol) ;
        let newcol = Curses.blue ;
        let newesc = EscapeCode.color(1, newcol) ;
        return newesc + "jsh" + orgesc ;
} ;
````

## Programming
Please read [jsh language manual](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTools/blob/master/Document/jsh-lang.md) to know how to describe the shell script by JavaScript.

## GUI
You can implement GUI by [Amber Programming Language](https://github.com/steelwheels/Amber/blob/master/Document/amber-language.md).
To learn about the language, see the [programming examples](https://github.com/steelwheels/Amber/blob/master/Document/amber-example.md).

Here is the sample script written by Amber Programming Language.
````
top: VBox {
    ok_button: Button {
        title:  String "OK"
        pressed: Event() %{
        	onsole.log("pressed: OK") ;
            leaveView(1) ;
        %}
    }
    cancel_button: Button {
        title:  String "Cancel"
        pressed: Event() %{
            console.log("pressed: Cancel") ;
            leaveView(0) ;
        %}
    }
}
````
Two buttons are defined in the script. When the "OK" button is pressed, the result of this script is "1". On the otherwise, when the "Cancel" button is pressed, the result value is "0".

The next GUI will be generated by the above script:

## Debugging
### Log Window
![Log Window](./Images/log-window.png)
The log window is used to output debug log of this application.
The window is shown the the [Log level](https://github.com/steelwheels/KiwiScript/blob/master/KiwiLibrary/Document/Enum/LogLevel.md) is higher than `nolog`. You can change the log level at [preference window](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTerminal/blob/master/Documents/Preference.md) or [Preference variable](https://github.com/steelwheels/KiwiScript/blob/master/KiwiLibrary/Document/Class/Preference.md).
